sequ compliance level 0 will read in two integers and then print out the sequence between those two integers. The following is the pseudocode I am following for this application.

Read in two integers or floats from the command line. 
	If parameters passed into the application is greater than 2 or less than 2
		Print usage message saying that exactly two parameters must be used
		Exit the program
	
	If the two parameters can not be casted to a float or int (i.e. a string has been 		passed in)
		Catch the exception that will be thrown.
		Print usage message saying that only integers can be used
		Exit the program
	
	Check to see if any of the parameters have a fractional part (meaning they are a 		float)	
		Print a warning that only integers should be used
		Continue program execution
		
	Set the start and end value for the sequence
		Set the start and end value for the sequence to be ints. If they are floats 		they will lose their precision. This is in response to the "SHOULD" keyword 		in the spec regarding the parameters passed in being ints.
		
	If start value is greater than end value
		Print nothing and exit program

	Else
		Print sequence of numbers from start value through end value. We print the 			end value.
		Exit program succesfully.
