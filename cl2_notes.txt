# Kyle Galbraith	Compliance Level 2 - Notes
Link to repo: https://kgalb2@projects.cecs.pdx.edu/git/masseycs300-kgalb2

- It may be better to make the switch to Python argparse for this compliance level as there are some additional flags to read in.

- The --words flag is simply setting the separator object to be ' '. I believe it would be best to have the --words flag be mutually exclusive from the -s flag. So you cannot use the --separator flag with the --words flag.

- The --pad flag is mutually exclusive to -w since it is merely a interpretation of -w where the left pad is a single character instead of 0. It will require some extra checks to make sure that the parameter for --pad that is passed in is only a single character. 

- Things left to do 11/19/13
	- Clean up the backslash escaping for -s and --pad since I was doing 	the wrong thing before.
	- Factor outputSlow and outputFast into the same function since they 	use the same idea. Probably need to add a function that does the array 	manipulating.
	- Implement --pad-spaces functionality which should be rather simple 	once --pad is complete as they both follow the same idea.
