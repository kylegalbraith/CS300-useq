- Going to need to check that the one word argument for --format-word. "arabic" == integers, "floating" == floating point, "alpha" == letters, "roman" == roman numerals. The uppercase versions of alpha and roman indicate uppercase sequences. These set the type of the sequence.

- Start, end, and increment must be in the format that is consistent with the format specified in --format-word.

- Arabic arguments for start, end, and increment can be promoted to roman numerals if --format-word=roman.

- When using the alpha format in --format-word, the increment argument must be arabic (integer). Otherwise, start and end must be in the same format as format-word.

- If no format-word is given, the format must be inferred from the end argument.
