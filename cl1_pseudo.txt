sequ compliance level 1 will read in flags --format/-f, --seperator/-s, --equal-width/-w,
followed by 1, 2, or 3 floats. Or it can read in --version or --help.

Read in --version or --help anywhere in the command line arguments. These arguments superceed any of the other arguments passed in as they hault program execution.
     If command line == --version
     	Print message showing the version number of sequ. Exit.
     If command line == --help
     	Print help documentation. Exit.
     If command line == --version --help
     	Print message showing the version number of sequ. Exit.
     If command line == --help --version
     	Print help documentation. Exit.	

Read in two integers or floats from the command line. 
	If parameters passed into the application is greater than 2 or less than 2
		Print usage message saying that exactly two parameters must be used
		Exit the program
	
	If the two parameters can not be casted to a float or int (i.e. a string has been 		passed in)
		Catch the exception that will be thrown.
		Print usage message saying that only integers can be used
		Exit the program
	
	Check to see if any of the parameters have a fractional part (meaning they are a 		float)	
		Print a warning that only integers should be used
		Continue program execution
		
	Set the start and end value for the sequence
		Set the start and end value for the sequence to be ints. If they are floats 		they will lose their precision. This is in response to the "SHOULD" keyword 		in the spec regarding the parameters passed in being ints.
		
	If start value is greater than end value
		Print nothing and exit program

	Else
		Print sequence of numbers from start value through end value. We print the 			end value.
		Exit program succesfully.
