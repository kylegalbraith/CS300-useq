# Kyle Galbraith	Compliance Level 0 - Notes

- Reading through the spec for CL0 it sounds like we are doing the sequ_fast function that only handles just printing out the integers.

- CL0 will only accept EXACTLY 2 integers. Meaning that if we pass in one integer we should throw an error, and if we pass in 3 integers we should throw an error. This is different from the traditional seq implementation which allows you to pass in 3 integers, FIRST INCREMENT LAST. So with CL0 we will not be implementing the step functionality that traditional seq has.

- Because the term SHOULD is used I am going to cast all floating point numbers to an int and display a warning message that the arguments passed in should be integers.

- Like traditional seq if x > y then we don't print anything out. This is another error case that we must handle in a slightly different way. I am suspecting an error function or a usage function is going to be handy here.

- CL0 does not call for us to implement -s to allow the user to specify a seperator for their sequence. However, the default should be /n which means it should be in the default sequ object. 

- Running through test cases I discovered that an interesting decision is made handling floats. I am going to take the floor of the float no matter what, so 6.1 and 6.7 both become 6. I am noting this because it might be useful to refactor this code to take the ceiling when the number behind the decimal point is greater than or equal to 5.

- All of my test cases have passed so far, additionally I thought of new test cases regarding 0's.
