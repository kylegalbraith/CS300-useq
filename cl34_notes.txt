- Going to need to check that the one word argument for --format-word. "arabic" == integers, "floating" == floating point, "alpha" == letters, "roman" == roman numerals. The uppercase versions of alpha and roman indicate uppercase sequences. These set the type of the sequence.

- Start, end, and increment must be in the format that is consistent with the format specified in --format-word.

- Arabic arguments for start, and end can be promoted to roman numerals if --format-word=roman.

- When using the alpha format in --format-word, the increment argument must be arabic (integer). Otherwise, start and end must be in the same format as format-word.

- If no format-word is given, the format must be inferred from the end argument. 

- Various cases to look at
	-F alpha one ten
		one two three ... ten
	-F alpha 1 ten
		ERROR - start limit not in the alpha format
	-F ten
		one two three ... ten because we must infer from end=ten that 			the output should be alpha
	-F alpha one 2 ten
		one three five seven nine
	-F alpha one 2.1 ten
		ERROR - Step is not of type arabic (integer)

- The case where you have to determine the format for format word from the end argument has an edge case where the format you are trying to determine is alpha. Need to come up with a way to catch this case without exiting.
